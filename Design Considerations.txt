# Requirements
- Organize videos on computer by various properties (view, sort and filter).
- View on gallery on a TV via HDMI. Must be large enough to see from the couch but also small enough to view a number of them on a single screen. 
- Must support a LOT of videos (>1000) and be fast.
- Must consist of a single executable. No "installation".
- Properties must include things like name, description, genere, movie ratings, release date, etc.
- Must be able to retrieve this information from the internet by itself.
- Target audience is a normal computer user. Not a developer or computer expert.

# High-level Design Choices
* As a web page/javascript? Requires many files. No robust means to gather properties. Not user-friendly installation. Subject to vagaries of browers.
* Target OS? Microsoft Windows. Just because it is what I know and what my laptop runs.
* Client-Server (irrespective of language)? Again, not average-user-friendly, higher complexity, and lower maintanibility. Does user really want a server running all the time?
* As a standalone app? Easy to run, just drop into folder and execute.
* Language
  + C++ - Workable, but unecessary complexity and more difficult to maintain.
  + C# - Faster and easier to maintain. Has no performance bottlenecks that low-level C++ needs to overcome. Supporting Win7+. Natively supports requisite https and regex.
    - WinForms? Can support large number of gallery items.
    - WPF? Gallery cannot support large number videos.

Resulting decision - .net winforms.
